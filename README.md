# Basic-Amusement-Park-Simulator

300 guests are randomly generator all with different ages, amount of money, ticket amount and the amount of rides that they will ride if possible.

the program will simulate the fair and will feedback the statistics of the fair.

Basically both of the fairSimulator.c and modifedFairSimulator.c do the exact same thing the only difference being that the regualar one uses static allocation while the modified one uses dynamic allocation.

To compile and run either or:

``gcc -o fair fairSimulator.c`` or ``gcc -o mod modifiedFairSimulator.c``

``./fair`` or ``./mod``
